The amount of data that companies are generating is exploding (the volume, the velocity, and the variety), and analysing large data sets, so-called big data, is becoming a key basis of competition, underpinning new waves of productivity growth, innovation, and consumer surplus. As this advancements advance further with greater developments of technologies to compliment these advancements, the need and beauty of simplicity will become evermore striking. While a model could be developed to predict who was most likely to survive, simple statistics were used to make this prediction. The frequent and key use of simple techniques compared to model creation reinforces the skills used for model creation, while at the same tim improving timing and quality of decision making for prediction techniques. 

In order to make the prediction for who be most likely to survive, the data was first split between those who survived and those who did not. Then summary statistics were used on the dataframe containing the data on the Titanic passengers who survived. This coupled with diagrams in _Challenge 3_ were used to make this prediction. The summary statistics for those who survived were found to be:


|       |     pclass |   survived |      age |      sibsp |      parch |     fare |
|:------|-----------:|-----------:|---------:|-----------:|-----------:|---------:|
| count | 425        |        425 | 425      | 425        | 425        | 425      |
| mean  |   1.88706  |          1 |  28.819  |   0.491765 |   0.538824 |  53.2589 |
| std   |   0.847553 |          0 |  15.0044 |   0.704134 |   0.80916  |  72.7214 |
| min   |   1        |          1 |   0.1667 |   0        |   0        |   0      |
| 25%   |   1        |          1 |  20      |   0        |   0        |  13      |
| 50%   |   2        |          1 |  28      |   0        |   0        |  26.25   |
| 75%   |   3        |          1 |  38      |   1        |   1        |  63.3583 |
| max   |   3        |          1 |  80      |   4        |   5        | 512.329  |

Therefore, amongst passengers onboard the Titanic during the time it was sinking, females in the age range 28-43, who were in 1st Class, had the greatest odds of survival compared to other persons, followed by females in similar positions but in the 14-28 age range. These odds of survival are even greater if there is maximum one family member (spouse, sibling, parent, etc.) onboard.
