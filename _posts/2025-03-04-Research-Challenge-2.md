# [](#The-Uncharted-Island-Puzzle)The Uncharted Island Puzzle

You are the leader of a small team that has crash-landed on an uncharted island. The island is lush, filled with unknown plants and animals, and appears to have no signs of human civilization. You have limited supplies:

> 3 liters of water
> A small knife
> A broken radio (possibly repairable)
> A map that only shows the coastline but no details of the interior


You also have six team members, each with different strengths and weaknesses:

> An experienced biologist (weak and injured, but knowledgeable about plants and animals)
> A strong but impatient engineer (practical, but sometimes reckless)
> A medical student (has limited experience, but can provide basic medical care)
> A philosopher (a deep thinker but lacks survival skills)
> A young, fit but inexperienced hiker (quick learner, eager but impulsive)
> Yourself (you decide your own strengths)

## [](#Your-Task:)Your Task:

> What are your immediate priorities, and how do you make your first decision?

> What long-term strategies do you put in place for survival or escape?

> If a conflict arises between team members, how do you handle it?
